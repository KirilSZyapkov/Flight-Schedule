# Flight-Schedule

You will receive an array with arrays. 

First array (at index 0) will hold all flights on specific sector in the airport. The second array (at index 1) will contain new changed statuses of some of the flights at this airport. The third array (at index 2) will have a single string, which will be flight status you need to check. When you put all flights into an object, and change the statuses depends on the new information on the second array. You must print all flights with the given status from the last array.
